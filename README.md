# Geozones

Geozones node for Aerostack2.

Params:
- config_file: Polygons that define geofences are defined here. (IMPORTANT) Remember that the order in which points are given defines how the polygon is built, this means that n point will be conected to n+1 point and so on. Last point will be connected to the first point.
Config file parameters:

    - **id** (int): geozone id 
    - **alert** (int): generated alert
    - **type** (string): geofence or geocage. Geofence will generate alert on entering the area, geocage will generate alert on exiting the area. 
    - **data_type** (string): gps or cartesian. 
    - **polygon** (list(2DPoint)): List of 2D points that forms the polygon. Should at least be 3. Order matters. 
    - **z_up** (float): up limit, always in cartesian.
    - **z_down** (float): down limit, always in cartesian.
